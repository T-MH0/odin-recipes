        <p class="para">This recipe is <em>even easier</em> than cooking that fried chicken, but it does require some planning ahead.
        Follow along as I walk you through these easy steps and when you're finished you will be <strong>amazed</strong> at how 
        simple it really is.</p>

        <h4 class="instructionstitle">Here is what you will need</h4>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Potatoes</li>
            <li>Salt/Pepper</li>
            <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="instructionstitle">Here are the steps</h4>
        <ol class="bullets">
            <li>Your first step is to cut the potatoes into the size fries you want to make</li>
            <li>Next, fill a large tub with water. Throw all the cut potatoes in and top with ice.
            They will need to stay in cold water for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Now that they have soaked, it's time to dry them off and cook.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a cast iron skillet to 325 degrees.</li>
            <li>It is now time to throw your fries in the oil. They will only need a few minutes each.
            You're watching for them to turn a light golden color.</li>
            <li>When done, pull them out and place them aside to cool. Continue doing this until all your
            fries have cooked.</li>
            <li>We'll be double frying them, so when all are cooled, put them back into the oil for another
            couple minutes. When they darken, they will be done. </li>
            <li>Final step. Put them in a bowl and season.</li>
        </ol>
