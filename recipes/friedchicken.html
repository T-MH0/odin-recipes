        <p class="para">I am in no way a good chef. This is something I saw my father make once as a child, and I 
        had to recreate it using imagination. I did make it, and it turned out really good.</p>

        <h4 class="instructionstitle">What you need</h4>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Chicken breast (as many as you want)</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>

        </ul>

        <h4 class="instructionstitle">How to cook</h4>
        <p class="para">There is no need to follow these steps religously. I never do. Feel it out for yourself. Play
        around a little. Cooking time, seasonings, even the order you go in. These are all things that can 
        change <strong>without</strong> ruining the meal. Frying is one of the easiest ways to cook in my opinion. Once you 
        get setup, all you're doing is throwing floured chicken into the hot oil for a few minutes.</p>
        <p class="para">Here are the steps:</p>
        <ol class="bullets">
            <li>The first step will be to cut the chicken breasts in strips. Cut these down the lenth
            of the breast.</li>
            <li>Dump some flour into a bowl and mix with your seasoning.</li>
            <li>Next, you'll want to coat the strips in flour completely.</li>
            <li>Crack a few eggs into a bowl then whisk until the yolk is mixed with the whites.</li>
            <li>Dip the floured chicken into the egg, then back into the flour. That's all.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para">This is when you will put the oil in a cast iron skillet. Heat on the stove until the oil is 
        375 degrees. Put the chicken in, a few strips at a time, and watch for them to turn that golden brown
        color. To confirm they are cooked thorougly, we will test the internal temp of the biggest piece in the 
        skillet. Anything above 165 degrees is good.</p>
